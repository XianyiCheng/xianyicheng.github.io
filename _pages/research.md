## Dexterous Manipulation Planning

How do we achieve dexterity in manipulation? Dexterity is not only from the manipulator, but also from the environments and the planned actions. I'm studying how to enable a robot to perform more dexterous manipulation tasks with even simple grippers. Environment contacts, external forces like the gravity, and regrasping motions are all our friends. Right now I'm focusing on how to plan contact-rich robotic interactions. This problem is challenging due to the discontinuity and hybrid nature of  contacts.

This is our first step [<span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">[(paper here)]</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01454).

## Manipulation with Suction Cups



If there is an octopus civilization, maybe most of its robotic manipulation study will be about suction cups.  However, human beings only use vacuum suction cups for pick and place. Suction cups have the potential to be powerful manipulators. We want to explore what other manipulation tasks suction cups can do, and extend our study to soft robotic fingers.

## Screwdriving



We are interested in screwdriving for mini-screws. Hundreds of billions of small screws are assembled in consumer electronics industry every year, yet reliable screwdriving automation remains one of the most
challenging tasks.

To study the screwdriving processes, we collected a large screwdriving dataset including more than 8,000 screwdriving operations. For more information, please visit [<span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">our dataset webpage</span>](http://mlab.ri.cmu.edu/index.php/research/datasets).


We also developed a data efficient failure detection and stage classification framework for screwdriving [<span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">[here]</span>](https://xianyicheng.github.io/files/cheng_case19.pdf).
