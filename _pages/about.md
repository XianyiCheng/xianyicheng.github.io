Xianyi Cheng 程先仪
-----

Hi, I'm Xianyi Cheng. I'm a PhD student at [the Manipulation Lab](http://mlab.ri.cmu.edu), Carnegie Mellon University. I'm advised by [Matt Mason](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mason/) and [Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~choset/). My research interests are in contact-rich robotic interactions.
